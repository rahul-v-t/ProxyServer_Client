It is a cost-cutting time for the cruise ship Royal Caribs. Captain Joe, comes up with a new deal with the satellite internet provider. According to this agreement, the internet service provider will charge the ship based on the number of TCP connections made from the ship. They donâ€™t care about the total data transferred. 
Joe called his IT guy Ron and he came up with the new system design. He said he could process all the HTTP requests from the ship with just a single TCP outgoing connection from the ship. In order to access the internet with the new system, everyone should use the proxy running inside the ship. There will not be additional requirements.

The Design
The client application will connect to the proxy(ship proxy) running inside the local network of the ship. 
There will be an open TCP connection between the ship proxy and the custom proxy server running offshore. This TCP connection will never be closed and all the http requests coming from the ship will be transmitted through this one by one.



Problem statement
You need to design the proxy client and proxy server.
It should be possible to configure ship proxy as proxy in browser settings(ex chrome).
The system needs to handle the HTTP/s requests sequentially(one by one). For example, if 3 HTTP requests come to the proxy client parallelly, the system has to fulfil the request 1, then request 2 and finally, request 3.

FYI: proxy client and ship proxy refers to exactly the same system/service/code.
